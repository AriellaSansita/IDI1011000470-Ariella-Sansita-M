**Smart Campus Assistant Chatbot**

**Project Overview**
The Smart Campus Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot built using Google Dialogflow to help students, visitors, and staff easily navigate the campus. It provides quick and reliable answers about locations, facilities, events, office hours, transportation, and emergency information — all through simple, natural conversations.
Many students and visitors often struggle to find specific buildings, check office timings, or get event details. This chatbot acts as a virtual campus guide, offering accurate and accessible information anytime, reducing confusion and saving time.
The goal of this project is to design and deploy a user-friendly, efficient chatbot that enhances campus communication, improves accessibility, and provides a seamless support experience for everyone.

Campus Locations – Gives directions or information about specific places on campus. Covers 25 major areas such as the Library, Auditorium, Cafeteria, Gym, Science Block, Medical Centre, and more.

**Deployment Instructions**
The chatbot was designed, trained, and tested on Google Dialogflow. All intents, entities, and responses were configured within the platform.
